            <h2>Why does Origin Energy suck?</h2>
            <h3>Electricity & Gas Account Protection - There is NONE!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-text">Origin Energy openly admits that it permits anyone to close an existing Origin Energy account by any 3rd party by simply applying for a new account at the same address. Origin Energy does not check any application for a new account and will just close your electricity and gas account (service) without asking you if you wish to cancel or are moving out - they simply close it!</li>
                <li class="list-text">The Energy Ombudsman is aware of this issue and says it's just bad luck for anyone caught up in this nightmare of having their electricity and gas shut off without warning - it is a complete sham and appalling conduct. Shame on you Origin Energy!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Origin Energy scam with United Energy - Quite Extraordinary!</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="list-text">A United Energy technician will arrive at your premises and request a meter check. In your next bill you will get an enormous charge which Origin Energy says is because of the peak electricity that your premises requires, and they must make available for you! and of course charge 5 figures or more for it!!</li>
                <li class="list-text">This is a complete and utter lie. The technician maxes out your meter on the day they check it. Then Origin Energy claims this as a peak usage event and charges you thousands of dollars under the guise they must make this potential peak use available to your premises. Which they have manufactured via the United Energy technician</li>
                <li class="list-text">The Energy Ombudsman is aware of this issue and says they cannot do anything about it, which to be frank, they never do anything about these rouge retailers working in cahoots with the wholesalers!</li>
                <li class="list-text">Shame on your Energy Ombudsman - you are just as bigger scammer as Origin Energy is.</li>
            </ul>
